# ðŸŒŸ XML Projects

This repository demonstrates the use of **XML technologies** across multiple projects to handle, validate, and transform structured data in various real-world domains. The projects leverage **XML**, **DTD**, **XSD**, and **XSLT** to model data, ensure validation, and create user-friendly visual outputs.
