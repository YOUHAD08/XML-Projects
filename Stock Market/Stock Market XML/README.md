# ðŸ“Š Stock Market Project

This project showcases the use of **XML** for modeling, validating, and transforming stock market data, divided into two parts:

1. **Stock Market DTD**:  
   Uses **DTD (Document Type Definition)** to define and validate the structure of `Bource.xml`, with transformation to an HTML file.

2. **Stock Market XML**:  
   Uses **XSD (XML Schema Definition)** for advanced XML validation and structure definition, followed by transformation to HTML.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- **Stock Market DTD**: Located in the `Stock Market DTD` folder.
- **Stock Market XML**: Located in the `Stock Market XML` folder.

Each folder includes:
- XML definition files (`DTD`/`XSD`)
- XML datasets
- Transformation stylesheets (`XSL`) and resulting HTML files.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Needed

- XML Editors: IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or Notepad++
- XSLT Processors: Saxon, Xalan, or a compatible web browser
- Any web browser for viewing HTML files

---

## ðŸŒŸ Summary

Explore XML validation with both **DTD** and **XSD**, and learn how to transform structured data into visually presentable HTML using **XSLT**.  
Happy Coding! ðŸ˜Š
