# 💳 Bank Account Statement Management XML Project

This project demonstrates how **XML technologies** can be used to develop solutions for managing **bank account statements**. It enables the handling of account balances, transaction details (credits and debits), and statement dates while leveraging **DTD, XSD**, and **XSLT** to validate, structure, and transform the data into a user-friendly format.

## 📜 Introduction

The **Bank Account Statement Management Application** is designed to demonstrate the ability of **XML-based technologies** to handle structured data. Using **Document Type Definition (DTD)** and **XML Schema (XSD)**, the project ensures the accuracy and validity of the data. Additionally, **XSLT** stylesheets are used to transform XML data into visualized **HTML reports** for easy comprehension.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

- **Validation**: Ensures the integrity of XML documents through both **DTD** and **XSD**.
- **Transformation**: Converts XML data into HTML with the help of **XSL stylesheets** for better usability.
- **Visualization**: Presents clear, visual representations of XML tree structures and various report views.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

| **Technology** | **Purpose**                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **XML**         | Stores and structures the bank statement data. |
| **DTD**         | Defines basic validation rules for the XML.   |
| **XSD**         | Provides advanced validation of XML structure. |
| **XSLT**        | Transforms XML into browser-readable HTML.    |

## 🏛 Key Features

1. **XML Validation**:
    - Use of DTD to define basic structural rules.
    - Use of XSD for stricter and more complex validation.

2. **Multiple Views for Data**:
    - **General View**: Displays all account data, along with credit and debit totals.
    - **Filtered View**: Creates a filtered list, e.g., specific account details.

3. **User-Friendly Output**: Generates well-designed HTML reports formatted for easy consumption using XSL stylesheets.
